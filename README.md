How to prevent congestion in datacenter networks?

# List of network topologies (that we can use to record perf tests and modify
- Fat Tree

- Leaf-Spine


 TODO: start implementing datacenter network topologies  them (in any language you are comfortable with) to analyze path lengths to a fixed destination
 
# Open Questions
Are there alternate topologies for datacenter networks where not regular to help w in-cast?
So lets start w original datacenter topology and then can we change it to prevent congestion in datacenter network?
What if we break the symmetry of datacenter network to prevent congestion before the “busy” node?
